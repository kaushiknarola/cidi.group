== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How can I show different custom fields for different Products? =
Using the Field display rules, the field can be set to display for a particular product or products as well as based on a category or categories. By setting a display rule based on Product/Category, you can have a different field for different Product/Categories. You can logically combine more than one rule with OR and AND functions.

Yes, you can. Enter the href tag in the given format as Label to display the field Label as a Clickable Link:

= How to set the field unselected by default for a Select field and throw an alert to select one before moving to cart? =
Simply add a PIPE symbol ( | ) before the first option. The Select field will be left unselected for the customer to choose from at the Product page. 
Marking the select field as required, will throw the alert when a user tries to add the product to cart without making the selection.

= Is there a difference between the Telephone field and number field? How are these fields different from the regular Text field? =
The telephone field and number field are different from the Text field.
